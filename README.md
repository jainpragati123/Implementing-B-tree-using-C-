# Implementing-B-tree-using-C-
This project is small version of database system. Where we efficiently implement the B+ Tree for fast and efficient access of files in the disc. Your database tuples will be stores as a .txt file in DBFiles folder corresponding FILE* will be saved in the leaf node. Above step is done to mimic the disc-block access
